# Profile-Page
It's a personal profile website to showcase the projects I have worked on and my skillset.

Tech used - HTML5, CSS3 and JS alongwith Firebase databse integration for contact form. Any user which enters contact details to the form will send the data to a firebase database, which can be accessed at any time. 

Overall design and presentation(especially the skills and portfolio grid) has been inspired from an opensource codepen Personal Portfolio page - https://codepen.io/Omega_Coding/pen/ZXqJaq
